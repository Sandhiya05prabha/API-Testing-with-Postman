**DOMAIN**:   SOFTWARE TESTING 

**DURATION**: 4 WEEKS 

**MENTOR**:   NEELA SANTHOSH 

**DESCRIPTION**: This project demonstrates basic API testing using Postman. The main objective of this task is to understand how to test REST APIs by sending requests, validating responses, and handling different scenarios such as success and error cases.

In this task, authentication is handled through Postman login. By signing in to Postman, authorized access is provided to interact with the API endpoints. Once authenticated, different API requests are executed to verify proper communication between the client and the server.

Data retrieval is performed using GET requests. The project includes multiple GET scenarios such as retrieving all users, retrieving a single user by ID, and checking the response for an invalid user. These scenarios help in validating status codes, response structure, and error handling of the API.

The project also includes a POST request to create a new user. This request validates the API’s ability to accept input data and return a successful response with a newly created resource ID. The response status code is verified to ensure correct API behavior.

Additionally, a DELETE request is used to validate resource removal functionality. This helps in understanding how APIs handle delete operations and return appropriate responses.

Overall, this project provides hands-on experience in API testing concepts such as authentication, data retrieval, request methods (GET, POST, DELETE), response validation, and status code verification using Postman. This task improves understanding of RESTful APIs and basic API testing workflows.
